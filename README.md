# react-bootstrap-webpack-node-express-boilerplate
The bare minimum boilerplate required for React, React-Bootstrap, Webpack, Node and Express development. I tried my best to keep it simple. I will also try to keep it up to date with the latest versions of tools.


to install: `git clone https://github.com/appsciences/react-bootstrap-webpack-node-express-boilerplate.git` 

to develop: run node with `npm start`, run webpack in 'watch' mode (automatically rebuild on changes) with `npm run develop`
