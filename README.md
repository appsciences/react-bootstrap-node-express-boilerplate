# react-bootstrap-webpack-node-express-boilerplate
The bare minimum boilerplate required for React, React-Bootstrap, Webpack, Node and Express development. I tried my best to keep it simple. I will also try to keep it up to date with the latest versions of tools.

to clone: git clone 
to develop: npm run develop
